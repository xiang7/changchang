             <p> NARRATIVE</p>
<p>This project proposes an urbanism theory for Chengdu- which is a metropolitan in mid- west China.  For most of the Chinese cities, urbanization happened within a short time compared with western cities. So are the urbanization theories- western urban theories are developed with the development of urban cities; however, most Chinese cities simply apply the western urban theories in the eastern setting. In the process of studying western urban theories, time, programs, space, people and materiality appear to be the most important aspects. In terms of those five aspects, one dynamic spot in Chengdu named Kuanzhai has the value to be studied. And in the process of analyzing Kuanzhai, differences with western urban theories are found and there are more to be added. The final criteria is generalized based on both the study of western urban theories and the analysis of successful spot Kuanzhai. The categories of it, are  physical and material. To prove the generality and significance of the eastern- oriented criteria, two other spots in the same ring are found in Chengdu to test the criteria.  In this project, the ambition is to find out the criteria towards advancing a humane development model for Chinese cities.</p>
